## Problem: Logistic Regression and Classification

```{r load packages}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r data preparation, include=F}
# Notice that we hide the code and the results here
# Using `include=F` in the chunk declaration. 

hd_data <-  read.csv("FRAMINGHAM.dat.txt")
### Renames, setting the variables with correct natures...
names(hd_data)[1] <- "HD"
hd_data$HD <- as.factor(hd_data$HD)
hd_data$SEX <- as.factor(hd_data$SEX)
str(hd_data)
#tail(hd_data, 1)    # The last row is for prediction
hd_data.new <- hd_data[1407,] # The female whose HD will be predicted.
hd_data <- hd_data[-1407,]  # take out the last row 
hd_data.f <- na.omit(hd_data)
```

We note that this dataset contains 307 people diagnosed with heart disease and 1086 without heart disease.
```{r table heart disease, echo = F, comment = " "}
# we use echo = F to avoid showing this R code
table(hd_data.f$HD) # HD: 307 of "0" and 1086 "1" 
```

After a quick cleaning up here is a summary about the data:
```{r data summary}
summary(hd_data.f)
```

**A)**
Create a training dataset with 1000 observations and a testing dataset with the rest of the data. Using `set.seed(1)`.

```{r create training and testing data sets}
set.seed(1)

#number of total observations
N <- length(hd_data.f$HD)
#generate indices for training data
index.train <- sample(N, 1000)
#training data
hd_data.train <- hd_data.f[index.train,]
#testing data
hd_ddata.test <- hd_data.f[-index.train,]
```


**B)** 
Our goal is to fit a well-fitting model, that is still small and easy to interpret (parsimonious).

1. Use AIC as the criterion for model selection. Find a logistic regression model with small AIC through exhaustive search in the training dataset. Call this model `fit.aic`.

```{r}

```

2. Use the model chosen from part A1 as the final model. Write a brief summary to describe important factors relating to Heart Diseases (i.e. the relationships between those variables in the model and heart disease). Make sure to define â€œimportant factorsâ€ in your words.

3. Liz is a patient with the following readings: `AGE=50, GENDER=FEMALE, SBP=110, DBP=80, CHOL=180, FRW=105, CIG=0`. What is the probability that she will have heart disease, according to our final model?

4. Consider using `fit.aic` for classification in the test dataset. Display the ROC curve using `fit.aic`. Explain what ROC reports and how to use the graph. 

**C)** 
1. Use BIC as the criterion for model selection. Find a logistic regression model with small BIC through exhaustive search. Call this model `fit.bic`. Compare `fit.bic` and `fit.aic`.

2. Overlay two ROC curves with the test dataset: One from `fit.bic`, the other from `fit.aic` from part A1. Based on the ROC curves, which one do you prefer?
